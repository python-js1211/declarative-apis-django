Overview
========

django-declarative-apis is a framework built on top of Django aimed at teams implementing RESTful APIs. It provides
a simple interface to define endpoints declaratively. Some benefits to using django-declarative-apis:

* Define endpoints declaratively
* Define model-bound and unbound resource endpoints with a consistent interface
* OAuth 1.0a authentication out of the box
* Define resource and endpoint-bound tasks, promoting modularity
* Define synchronous and asynchronous tasks (asynchronous tasks implemented with Celery)
* Separation of concerns between request body processing and business logic
